# edUi Conference Chatbot

This is an example chatbot built on top of the Microsoft Bot Framework Node.JS SDK v4. It utilizes data from the 2017 and 2018 [edUi Conferences](https://www.eduiconf.org), and shows how to build a conference bot that informs attendees of speaker sessions based on speaker name, subject, or location. It will also inform attendees of the time of sessions, and allows them to "save" a session, which then kicks off proactive messages as reminders. The speaker sessions are displayed as hero cards with card actions.

This example bot is detailed in a forthcoming book on building bots with the Microsoft Bot Framework. It includes a description of building it from end-to-end. In addition, it is the subject of a forthcoming [Bots + Beer](https://botsandbeer.com) meetup.
